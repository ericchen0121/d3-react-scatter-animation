# Playing With React and D3

I started with the Playing with React skeleton and followed along to create a static Scatterplot with D3 and React.

Then combining techniques from Swizec's article about using D3 transition in React:
https://swizec.com/blog/using-d3js-transitions-in-react/swizec/6797

I created a new CircleAnimate component that transfers control to D3 to animate the circles.

I also used this bl.ock as a scatterplot animation reference:

This is a fully componentized D3-React implementation with animation.
